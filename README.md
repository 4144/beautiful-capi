# Beautiful Capi

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PetrPPetrov/beautiful-capi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PetrPPetrov/beautiful-capi)

Beautiful Capi is a tool which automates the creation of compiler-independent
and binary compatible C++ libraries across different C++ compilers.
Libraries prepared by Beautiful Capi enable C++ libraries to be compiled once then used many times
by the other C++ compilers without any recompilation.
Of course, the compiled C++ libraries are compatible only on the same platforms
and architectures where they were built. For instance, a shared library which was built by Visual Studio 2015
C++ compiler could be wrapped and called by Mingw Clang C++ compiler on Windows operating system
(allowing both forward and backward compatibility) and vice versa.

This tool generates the required C++ and C code to wrap your C++ classes for use in a compiler-independent way.

Another main concept is to generate a well-crafted beautiful C API,
which is clear, readable and visibly suitable for human usage (not only for computers or compilers).

Beautiful Capi is written in Python 3. Note it _does not parse_ the library source code to obtain its
[API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) description.
Instead of that, as author you should provide a library API description in XML format.
Usually such XML files which describe the library API are created by hand.
There are no tools for creating XML API description files yet, however, such tools could be created in the future.
There are [plans](https://github.com/PetrPPetrov/beautiful-capi/issues/24)
to add support of some convenient DSL (Domain-Specific Language) in parallel to XML format. 

Beautiful Capi is not intended as a tool for automating cross-language C++ library creation (for instance,
the cases when a C++ library is used in Java or C# application) like [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/).
However, in the future Beautiful Capi could introduce such features and support for some other target languages.
For details please see [issue 7](https://github.com/PetrPPetrov/beautiful-capi/issues/7) and
[issue 39](https://github.com/PetrPPetrov/beautiful-capi/issues/39).

The main goal of this project is to produce highly efficient code and design elegance.
This goal is informed by knowing Java programmers prefer to write wrappers by hand to avoid sub-optimal SWIG outputs.

Beautiful Capi has many examples which help to learn it step by step.
You can find all examples in [examples](https://github.com/PetrPPetrov/beautiful-capi/tree/master/examples) folder.

Regarding the license - the code generated by this tool can be used for any purpose, including commercial.
Only the code generator tool itself is subject to GPL licensing.
