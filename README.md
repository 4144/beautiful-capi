# beautiful-capi
Another wrapper for producing beautiful C API.

This program generates all required C++ and C code to wrap
your C++ classes to use them in compiler-independent way.

Another main idea is to generate a beautiful C API
which is suitable for human usage (not for computers or compilers).

*Background, Motivation*

In  today's  modern  software  development  environment, there are may
C/C++ parsing techniques such as SWIG, web services many more.

This  project is to write a new automatic code generation tool similar
to SWIG, except the output is not Java/Python, it is ANSI-C.

This is a little different than SWIG, generating pure C API output, formatted to be easily human readable.
Compiled  libs could be linked by another compiler or language (unlike
default C++ to C++ which requires the same compiler to be used on both
sides).

For  example, a C++  vs2015  lib  could be wrapped and called by vs2008
using C api (allowing both forward and backward compatibility).

A further difference, the generation tool is written in Python, so is easily ported without compilation.

Also  it  has  a goal of high efficiency code, and design elegance. We
know  Java  programmers that prefer to write wrappers by hand to avoid
sub-optimal SWIG output. This prototype project will primarily be C++ applications calling C++ library classes, but via a wrapped API.
It's goal is not cross-language like SWIG.

Regarding the license, the code generated by this tool can be used for any purpose, including commercial.
Only the code generator tool itself is subject to GPL licensing.
