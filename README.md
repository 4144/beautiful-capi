# Beautiful Capi

Beautiful Capi is a tool which automatizes the creation of compiler-independent
and binary compatible (between different C++ compilers) C++ libraries.
Prepared by Beautiful Capi C++ libraries compiled once could be used many times
by the other C++ compilers without recompilation.
Of course, the compiled C++ libraries are compatible only on the same platforms
and architectures where they were built. For instance, a shared library which was built by Visual Studio 2015
C++ compiler could be wrapped and called by Mingw Clang C++ compiler
(allowing both forward and backward compatibility).

This tool generates the required C++ and C code to wrap your C++ classes to use them in a compiler-independent way.

Another main concept is to generate a beautiful C API,
which is visibly suitable for human usage (not only for computers or compilers).

Beautiful Capi is written in Python 3. It _does not parse_ the library source code to obtain its
[API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) description.
Instead of that, you should provide the library API description in XML format.
Usually XML files which describe the library API are created by hand.
There are not any tools for creating XML API description files yet, however, such tools could be created in the future.
There are [plans](https://github.com/PetrPPetrov/beautiful-capi/issues/24)
to add support of some convenient DSL (Domain-Specific Language) in parallel to XML format. 

Beautiful Capi is not intended as a tool for automatizing cross-language C++ libraries creation (for instance, 
the cases when a C++ library is used in Java or C# application) like [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/).
However, in the future Beautiful Capi could introduce such features and support of some target languages are planned.
For details please see [issue 7](https://github.com/PetrPPetrov/beautiful-capi/issues/7) and
[issue 39](https://github.com/PetrPPetrov/beautiful-capi/issues/39).

The main goal of this project is to produce highly efficient code and design elegance.
Knowing Java programmers prefer to write wrappers by hand to avoid sub-optimal SWIG outputs.

Regarding the license, the code generated by this tool can be used for any purpose, including commercial.
Only the code generator tool itself is subject to GPL licensing.
